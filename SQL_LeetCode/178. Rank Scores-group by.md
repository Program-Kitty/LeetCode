# 关键知识点

- Group by操作
其实没什么好说的，就是分组进行操作。
- The GROUP BY statement group rows that have the same values into summary rows, like "find the number of customers in each country".
- The GROUP BY statement is often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns.
```MySQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

- 什么情况下要用self join
```MySQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table1 T1, table1 T2
WHERE condition; -- T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table
```
例如：
```MySQL
SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City --注意引用时要用A.col, B.col
FROM Customers A, Customers B
WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
AND A.City = B.City 
ORDER BY A.City;
```
