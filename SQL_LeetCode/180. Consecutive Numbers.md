# 关键知识点
- lead和lag

```
LAG ( expression [, offset [, default] ] )
OVER ( [ query_partition_clause ] order_by_clause )
```


```SQL Server
SELECT DISTINCT num as ConsecutiveNums
FROM
(
SELECT num,LEAD(num) OVER(ORDER BY id) AS lead, LAG(num) OVER (ORDER BY id) AS lag
FROM Logs
)t
WHERE num=lead and num=lag;
#这个解法是借一个lead一个lag，选中间的那个；可以处理id不连续的问题
```


-self join, https://leetcode.com/problems/consecutive-numbers/solution/ 的图解非常好地说明了这一点
```MySQL
SELECT DISTINCT
    l1.Num AS ConsecutiveNums
FROM
    Logs l1,
    Logs l2,
    Logs l3
WHERE
    l1.Id = l2.Id - 1
    AND l2.Id = l3.Id - 1
    AND l1.Num = l2.Num
    AND l2.Num = l3.Num
;
```
