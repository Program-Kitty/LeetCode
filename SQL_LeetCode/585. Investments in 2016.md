# 关键知识点
- having 的用法
- concat 的用法

# having
The HAVING clause was added to SQL because the WHERE keyword could not be used with aggregate functions.
换句话说，group by之后如果想再对group by之后的数值做一些筛选，则可以用having来做。

```MySQL
SELECT column_name(s)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column_name(s)
HAVING condition
ORDER BY column_name(s);
```

# concat
concat不仅可以用来连接字符串，还可以用来对付类似坐标这样的东西。如果需要以两个attribute来判断一些事情（eg. Lat,Lon），
那么则可以用concat(lat, lon)来做，到时候需要group by lat, lon 两个attribute

```MySQL
select sum(TIV_2016) as TIV_2016
from insurance
where( TIV_2015 in(
        select distinct TIV_2015
        from insurance i1
        group by i1.TIV_2015
        having count(i1.TIV_2015) > 1)
    and concat(LAT, LON) in(
        SELECT   concat(LAT,LON)
        FROM     insurance i2
        GROUP BY LAT,LON
        HAVING   COUNT(*) = 1
    )
)
```
